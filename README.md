# postgreSQL-ETL
YouTube has been collecting data on their video streaming and the activities of user. They have recently shown their interest in the proper analysis of this data. The most important thing what they want to know is “what videos are users most interested in?” For the time being they have been following a very difficult way to query their data. 1- They have directories of JSON log files for the user activities. 2- They have a directory that contains Metadata of these videos in form of JSON files. We want you build a PostgreSQL database for performing a good Play Analysis of these videos. You will be doing the following things, 1- Optimization of tables by following a star schema (using fact and dimension tables) so that we can run queries. 2- Creating a database schema of these optimized tables and writing an ETL (Extract Transform and Load) layer to load data from JSON log files to this database.
